# SHARK ATTACK PROJECT
## THE PURPOSE
<hr>

This project has a double objective. The first one to use this nice project as a learning tool to apply my knowledge on cleaning data from a database by using pandas, using functions and different types of charts. 

The second one is to test some hypothesis on sharks behaviour, and mainly on attacks to humans, to, hopefully, help to confront some common prejudices, as we will see.

### Sharks behaviour: feeding and attacks to humans on a nutshell 
<hr>
Sharks have a very bad reputation, they are widely known by their attacks to humans, but little is known about their social behaviour.

There are 114 species of sharks, with also different routines. In general, sharks form large groups, are sociable animals and show cooperative behaviours, they fish and eat also other animals. But humans are not they prefered food, they avoid human contact as much as they can but still, some attacks to humans have been historically recorded.  

## So, what do I want to test?

Well, we know that the frequency of these attacks is rare, but, ideed, even when it happens, they do not attack to death. And here is the first hypothesis I am going to test,

Secondly, it has been reported that most victims of shark attacks were engaged in activities such as surfing, water skiing and boating, so I want to test whether the injuries that result from these attacks were mainly on lower limbs

## And how?
<hr>

For this study I imported [pandas module](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/index.html)

I used a very helpfull and rich graphing library, plotly that I would love to explore in detail in the future and I also used matplotlib

[Plotly Graphing Library ](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/?utm_source=mailchimp-jan-2015&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=generalemail-jan2015&utm_term=bubble-chart)

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/contents.html)

I applied functions created by myself, and that you will find in the Operations.py file.

By talking a lot with my collegues and teachers from Ironhack data analyst bootcamp.

## The conclusions of this descriptive analysis.
<hr>
Most shark attacks occur in the EEUU and Australia being the 37% and the 21% respectively, where water sports are frequent and also where human and shark boundaries may be less defined.

The conclusions of this study shed light on two main issues, the first one is that, indeed, Fatal attacks count only for the 23.3% of the total amount of attacks, meaning that a 76.7% of the victims survived... so, they are not such aggresive animals and, I suggest that these attacks could be related to two main factors. 
On the one hand, starving periods may make sharks move from their traditional habitat to approach coastlines and, eventually, they may attack a human, but this is extremely rare as human beings are not easy preys and their own life get in risk. On the other had, humans are extremely invasive, and thus we invade other beings habitat. One hypothesis that has been drawn is that when sharks attack a human in doing water sports, it is likely to be due to a case of mistaken identity, pointing out the similarity in shape between a sufboard and a seal...
Let's face it, we do not provide such a great meal for the risk it takes.

And, with this in mind, I checked whether the attacks to humans while doing water sports as surfing or swimming were more likely to be directed to lower limbs having. I found that lower limbs were injured more than any other part of the body: the 13% of cases while surfing, and the 12% while swimming, and still, they survived... so, did they really wanted to eat them? Did they just make a mistake? 

I you have seen documentaries about sharks, I know you know the answer, when they fish or hunt, they really mean it, and they will not give up so easily. 

To sum up, shark are not dangerous animals, but as far as you can, avoid messing with them..
